## Hello Traveler 👋, looks like you're a long way from home!
I don't know where you came from but if you're ever feeling homesick just let me know and I will ship you back in a package 📦. But if you have decided to stay welcome to my personal repo ✨. Not R.E.P.O like that new popular horror game where you collect valuables 💸 as a talking robot 🤖 and have to pay the "Tax man" without getting murdered by evil monsters: 👻 👽 👶 🗣. Repo as in repository, where you can learn more about me and read what I have to say 💡 

For now it will remain empty because I don't have much to say and have a lot on my plate. However I will tell you that I am currently enrolled in TTPR (Tech Talent Pipeline Residency) and I am both super excited and terrified. Wish me good luck if you see this 🍀.
